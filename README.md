# `notstd_detect`

This repository contains a fork of [`std_detect`](crates/std_detect/README.md) - Rust's
  standard library run-time CPU feature detection - called `notstd_detect`.

There are no changes in the code, it has just been uploaded to crates.io to be available and up-to-date.
The maintainers do not want to update the 4 years old version available on crates.io,
since it is meant to be available with `std::detect`.
Some features, however, are not available through `std::detect`.
